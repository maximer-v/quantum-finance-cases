# Gate-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Use Cases for the Finance Sector

This repository was created to compile real-world quantum machine learning cases. 

> **Note:** This content is not considering cases with quantum annealers, or mainly regarding optimization problems, but potential supervised and unsupervised machine learning cases boosted by quantum computation.

### Extract or Reference (2020)

"In 2020, CaixaBank developed the first machine learning algorithm to classify risks in Spanish banking leveraging quantum computing. In that case, CaixaBank combined quantum computing and conventional computing in different phases of the calculation process — to classify credit risk profiles. To do this, CaixaBank used a public data set corresponding to 1,000 artificial users, with a similar profile to existing customers, but with information configured specifically for the test."

### Extract or Reference (2022)

"QC Ware developed quantum machine learning algorithms that improve the accuracy of the models currently used to predict customer churn. During the collaboration the two teams developed novel methods that run on today’s classical computers and can already improve the prediction models, achieving a substantial increase in the previously tested customer retention model. Moreover, these algorithms will also run even faster on future quantum computers using the inherent ability of quantum computers to perform complex linear algebra tasks."
